# Notes

Disable open user registration after setting up your account. This can be done via the `/admin` web panel, if enabled, or by adjusting the `config.json` file. Alternatively via environment variables. See documentation [here](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Disable-registration-of-new-users).
